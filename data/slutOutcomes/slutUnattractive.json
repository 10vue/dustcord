  "You wandered like a tall giraffe in a busy street, too noticeable but with no business in sight. You made nothing today...",
  "Like a bunny with no one around to admire your soft ears, you found yourself ignored, no one seemed interested in what you had to offer.",
  "You lingered like a shy hedgehog in the corner, waiting for someone to notice, but no one did.",
  "You waited around like a dog with its tail between its legs, but no one bothered to give you a second glance.",
  "Like a cat caught in the rain, you waited for clients that never came.",
  "Youâ€™re like a lone wolf on a deserted road, howling for attention, but no one answers.",
  "You stood out like a flamingo in a crowd of pigeons, too tall and out of place. Clients ignored you completely."
